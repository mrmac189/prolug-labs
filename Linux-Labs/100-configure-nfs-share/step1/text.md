Your team has determined they need an NFS share to facilitate filesystem access across multiple servers from one central location.

Deploy the nfs server on node01

Share out a filesystem /share to any system

Verify that the system is being shared out

<br>

### Solution


Connect to node01

```plain
ssh node01
```

Verify there is no nfs package

```plain
dpkg -l | grep -i nfs
```

Deploy the nfs server package

```plain
apt -y install nfs-kernel-server
```

Verify that the server is running but nothing is being shared out.

```plain
systemctl status nfs-server.service --no-pager
ss -ntulp | grep 2049
showmount -e
```

Notice the service is running, the ports 2049 are open for TCP and udp connections, and no shares are being shared out.

Further verify that the firewall isn't running to complicate things

```plain
ufw status
```

Should see this disabled.

Let's create a directory to share out. We also need to prep it for other systems to connect and write by changing permissions.

```plain
mkdir /share
chown nobody:nogroup /share
```

Add the line ``` /share *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) ``` to /etc/exports to share out the directory.

```plain
vi /etc/exports
```
 
After doing this, you will need to restart the service to see the share.

```plain
systemctl restart nfs-server.service
showmount -e
```

Once you see the share, you're ready to move on to the client connection.

Remember to move back to controlplane node

```plain
exit
```
