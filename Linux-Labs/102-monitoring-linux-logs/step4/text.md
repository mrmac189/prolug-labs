You've setup all the pieces, now you have to create a dashboard in Grafana and verify that everything is working end to end.

Log into Grafana (and change the password if you didn't do it earlier)

Create the datasource for Loki in the the Datasource page. URL = http://127.0.0.1:3100

Create a dashboard (import 13639) that shows the log files for your server.

### Solution



Connect to Grafana and log in {{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}

Create the datasource for Loki in the the Datasource page. URL = http://127.0.0.1:3100 

Import the dashboard 13639 to view logs.

Verify the dashboard is working properly.
