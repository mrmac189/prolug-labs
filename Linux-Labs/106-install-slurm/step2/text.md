You have installed Slurm on two nodes and started the daemon. You want to verify the status of the cluster and the individual node readiness states.

### Solution



Run the command scontrol show config to see the state of the cluster. What information is important to see here?
```plain
scontrol show config
```

Can you find the log location for where slurmd and slurmctld are writing in your cluster?

```plain
scontrol show config | grep -i log
```

Where are your logs writing? Why might this information be useful to you as an administrator?

Run the sinfo -N command to see the state of the nodes.

```plain
sinfo -N
```

How many nodes do you see? What are the node status and what do those mean? (man sinfo or sinfo --help)

What new information do you see when you add to the sinfo command?

```plain
sinfo -N l
```

If you are confident that you cluster is running properly, you can move on to the next stage, which is running simple and batch type jobs against the cluster.
