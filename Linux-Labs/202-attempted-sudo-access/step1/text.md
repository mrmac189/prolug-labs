Your Security Operations team has informed you that an alert for sudo activity has happened on a server. Investigate the sudo logs and see what the user is attempting to do.

### Solution


User logging may take up to 60 seconds to execute and populate the logs for this. If you cannot easily wait 60 seconds, push this command

```plain
echo "I am patient and can wait 60 seconds"
sleep 60
```

Check the logs where Ubuntu keeps sudo requests. They may take up to 60 seconds to populate with the bad sudo requests.

```plain
tail -20 /var/log/auth.log
```

Also check 

```plain
tail -20 /var/log/syslog
```

You can search all the logs for baduser like this as well.

```plain
grep baduser /var/log/*
```

You will eventually see the line 
```plain
baduser : user NOT in sudoers
```

This indicates a user is trying to sudo and use elevated permissions that they do not have. We can then either remove user access permissions or grant them the correct permissions.This line is how you know you can continue with lab.

To see root's crontab and how we're causing all the failed sudo attempts, use this command:

```plain
crontab -l
```

You can see that root is using baduser account to attempt sudo commands that it doesn't yet have permissions to execute.
