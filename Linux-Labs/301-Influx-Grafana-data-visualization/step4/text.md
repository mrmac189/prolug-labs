You've setup all the pieces, now you have to create a dashboard in Grafana and verify that everything is working end to end.

Log into Grafana (and change the password if you didn't do it earlier)

Create the datasource for InfluxDB2 in the the Datasource page. URL = http://127.0.0.1:8086
You also need to know all of your client token, organization, and bucket information.

Create a dashboard that shows the telemetry information for your server from InfluxDB2.

### Solution



Connect to Grafana and log in {{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}

Create the datasource for InfluxDB in the the Datasource page. 
Change the Query Language to Flux
Set the URL = http://127.0.0.1:8086
Scroll all the way down and set: Organization, Bucket, and Token.

If you see "Datasource is working: 3 Buckets found" You know you connected properly.

Create a new Dashboard.
Select a new Panel.
Pick the data source InfluxDB.
Choose the sample query of "Filter by Value".

Verify the dashboard is working properly.
