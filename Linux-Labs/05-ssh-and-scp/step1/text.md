You are a new administrator and need to connect from the main jump server to another server in the organization. You realize you need a better understanding of the ssh connection process.

Connect to the other server and look at the specifics of the ssh connection.

### Solution


Check your connection to node01.

```plain
ssh node01
```

Type in exit to return to the original system

```plain
exit
```

Check system uptime and one layer of debug1.

```plain
ssh -v node01 'uptime'
```

What additional information was shown with the -v option? (debug1)

```plain
ssh -vv node01 'uptime'
```

What additional information was shown with the -vv option? (debug2)

```plain
ssh -vvv node01 'uptime' 
```

What additional information was shown with the -vvv option (debug3)

So we looked at a ssh connection over to node01. You should note that the keys are being used and that is why no password was asked to connect. We'll explore that more shortly.
