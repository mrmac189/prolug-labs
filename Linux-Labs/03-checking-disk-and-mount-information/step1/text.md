You are a new system administrator at a company. You've been tasked with finding out information about a set of servers that has very little to no documentation on it. 

Check physical disk information.

Echo the number of physical disks you have into /root/disks

Echo the number of partitions of that disk into /root/partitions

### Solution

Check disk information and count partitions

```plain
fdisk -l | grep -i vd
```

Why did we use VD?

Let's use another command to see that information another way.
```plain
lsblk
```

and

```plain
blkid
```

And, if you need the answer:

```plain
echo 1 > /root/disks
echo 3 > /root/partitions
```
